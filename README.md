# Road_Safety_Dashboard
Road Safety Data Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview

Road safety is a growing concern, with thousands of accidents happening every year due to a mix of human, environmental, and infrastructural factors. To better understand these patterns, this project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built on real accident data.

The dataset includes information such as accident dates, severity, weather conditions, and locations. By turning raw data into clear visual insights, the dashboard helps users quickly spot accident trends, analyze severity levels, and explore how external factors like weather and location impact road safety.

Objectives

Explore and analyze road accident datasets.

Track key KPIs, including:

Total number of accidents

Accident trends over time

Severity distribution

Weather impact on accidents

Provide a visually rich and interactive dashboard that supports better decision-making for policymakers, traffic authorities, and the public.
